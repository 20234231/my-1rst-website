        <h2>About Eddie Van Der Meer</h2>
        <center>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Eddie is a fingerstyle guitarist from the Netherlands. His continuous dedication to his passion has led to him creating high-quality covers of popular music, which has garnered him over 375 million views and over 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube.

            He first picked up the guitar when he was 10, and took lessons for basics from his neighbor. At age of 13, Eddie was inspired by Tommy Emmanuel to start learning fingerstyle. When he was 14, he was given the honor of being able to perform with Tommy Tommy on stage, which was uploaded as his first video on YouTube. A year later, he decided to create his own voice on the guitar, shifting his focus to arranging and covering songs. In 2013, he began taking YouTube more seriously and started building an audience.
            
            Eddie has successfully made his passion into a career and is delighted to be able to share his guitar music with the world.</p>
